        <h2>His Story</h2>
  <p><strong>Presley Oageng Chweneyagae</strong> (19 October 1984 – 27 May 2025) was a celebrated South African actor whose talent and humility touched audiences around the world. He rose to prominence with his unforgettable lead role in the 2005 film <strong>Tsotsi</strong>, which won the <strong>Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film</strong>.</p>

  <p>Born in Pretoria, Presley began acting in local theatre productions before transitioning to film, where his performance as a troubled young man in <em>Tsotsi</em> earned him international acclaim. He went on to star in several South African films and television dramas, always portraying his characters with depth, emotion, and purpose.</p>

  <p>Beyond the screen, Presley was committed to social upliftment. He mentored youth, advocated for second chances, and used his voice to speak out against injustice. His dedication to theatre remained strong throughout his career, as he believed in its power to heal and educate.</p>

  <p>Presley Chweneyagae passed away on <strong>27 May 2025</strong> at the age of 40 due to respiratory complications. According to his family, he had experienced severe breathing problems, and despite efforts by paramedics, he could not be saved.</p>

  <p>His passing leaves a void in the world of South African arts and culture. But his legacy — of compassion, storytelling, and resilience — lives on through his work and the lives he inspired.</p>

  <p>This memorial website honors his memory and preserves the story of a man who rose from humble beginnings to become one of South Africa’s most beloved and influential actors.</p>
